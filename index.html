            <h1>History of Chelsea FC</h1>   
            <img src = "img/chelsea-history.jpg" alt = "Chelsea History Photo">
            <p>In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium with the aim of turning it into a football 
            ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use 
            the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of 
            Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also 
            considered. Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook), opposite 
            the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly 
            afterwards.</p>

            <h1>Stamford Bridge - Home Ground of Chelsea FC</h1>  
            <img src = "img/stamfordbridge.jpg" alt = "Stamford Bridge Photo"> 
            <p>Chelsea have only had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the team's foundation. 
            It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 and for the first 28 years of its existence, it was used almost 
            exclusively by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In 
            1904 the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph, who had also purchased nearby 
            land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5 acre (51,000 
            m2) site. Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald Leitch, 
            who had also designed Ibrox, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park. Most football clubs were founded first, and 
            then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.</p>

            <p>Chelsea won their first major honour, the League Championship, in 1955. They won the FA Cup for the first 
               time in 1970 and their first European honour, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, in 1971. After a period of 
               decline in the late 1970s and 1980s, the club enjoyed a revival in the 1990s and had more success in cup 
               competitions. The past two decades have been the most successful in Chelsea's history: they won five of 
               their six league titles and the UEFA Champions League during this period. Chelsea are one of five clubs 
               to have won all three of UEFA's main club competitions, and the only London club to have won the 
               Champions League.</p>
